# NeXTPrinterControl
 Multi-function NeXT Laser Printer N2000 Control Utility
 
 This is the first version of a small K&R compatible C program, which allows the 
 administrator of a NeXT Step system to control and inquiry the status of a physically 
 connected NeXT Laser Printer N2000.
 
 Originally, the idea was to build a software tool that could allow the identification of
 faulty hardware, hence facilitating the restoration of existing printers, which are 
 almost all dead and needing care.
 
 However, to no surprise, the printer can only have a dialogue with the main unit if it
 is in perfect working order.
 So, the original scope of the project is definitely not fulfilled.
 
 The code has been developed (written) with the support of ChatGPT 4 (free version), as 
 a way for speeding up its development. 
 
 The functionality of the software have been compiled and thoroughly tested on an original
 NeXT Computer 030 running NeXTStep 3.3, complemented by a working NeXT N2000 printer.
 
 Use "make install" for installing the program and "make uninstall" for removing it.
 
 Refer to the manual page "man npctl" for the usage.
